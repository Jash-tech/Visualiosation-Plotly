 # PLANET OR PLASTIC?

Summary:
1. Plastic pollution is having a negative impact on our oceans and wildlife health
2. High-income countries generate more plastic waste per person
3. However, it is the management of plastic waste that determines the risk of plastic entering the ocean. High-income countries have very effective waste management systems; mismanaged waste – and plastic that ends up in the oceans – is therefore very rare. Poor waste management across many middle- and low-income countries means that these are the main sources of global ocean plastic pollution
4. This makes the improvement of waste management systems across the world critical to reducing plastic pollution.
